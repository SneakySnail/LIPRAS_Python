<b> History: </b>The backbone of the code was originally created by Jacob L. Jones during his post doc back in 2006-2007. In 2014, Chris M. Fancher continued development of the code created by Jacob and successfully turned it into a class file within MATLAB. Giovanni Esteves further built upon Chris's version by polishing the code and adding features to enhances its feasibility to new users. Finally, in 2016 Klarissa Ramos joined the Jones Research group and jointly with Giovanni they restructured the class file into a graphical user interface (GUI) which is now known as LIPRAS.

## What is LIPRAS?

**LIPRAS** [*LEEP-ruhs*], short for **Line-Profile Analysis Software**, is a graphical user interface for least-squares fitting of Bragg peaks in powder diffraction data. For any region of the inputted data, user can choose which profile functions to apply to the fit, constrain profile functions, and view the resulting fit in terms of the profile functions chosen. A Bayesian inference analysis can be carried out on the resulting least-squares result to generate a full description of the errors for all profile parameters.
